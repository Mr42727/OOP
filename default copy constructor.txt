n C++, a default copy constructor is a special member function that is automatically generated by the compiler if a class does not have a user-defined copy constructor. The default copy constructor creates a new object that is a copy of an existing object of the same class, by copying all of its member variables. Here's an example of a default copy constructor:

c
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
  int x, y;

  MyClass() {
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
  }

  MyClass(int x_, int y_) {
    x = x_;
    y = y_;
  }
};

int main() {
  MyClass obj1(1, 2);
  MyClass obj2 = obj1; // use default copy constructor
  cout << "obj1: " << obj1.x << " " << obj1.y << endl;
  cout << "obj2: " << obj2.x << " " << obj2.y << endl;
  return 0;
}
In this example, we define a class called MyClass that has two data members x and y. We define a default constructor that sets x and y to 0, and a parameterized constructor that initializes x and y with the given values. In main(), we create an object obj1 using the parameterized constructor with the values 1 and 2. We then create a new object obj2 by using the default copy constructor, which creates a new object that is a copy of obj1. We output the values of obj1 and obj2 to the console, which shows that they have the same values for x and y.

The default copy constructor works by copying all of the member variables of the existing object to the new object, which creates a shallow copy of the object. If the class has any pointers or dynamically allocated memory, the default copy constructor will copy the pointer values but not the underlying data, which can lead to problems if both objects end up trying to free the same memory. In this case, it is necessary to define a custom copy constructor to ensure proper copying of data.
