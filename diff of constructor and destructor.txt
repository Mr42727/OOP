In C++, constructors and destructors are both special member functions of a class that are used to initialize and clean up objects, respectively. Here are the differences between constructors and destructors:

Name: A constructor has the same name as the class, whereas a destructor has the same name as the class but with a tilde (~) character in front of it.

Purpose: A constructor is used to initialize an object when it is created, whereas a destructor is used to clean up an object when it is destroyed.

Invocation: A constructor is automatically invoked when an object is created, whereas a destructor is automatically invoked when an object is destroyed.

Arguments: A constructor can have arguments, whereas a destructor does not take any arguments.

Return type: A constructor does not have a return type, whereas a destructor does not return a value.

Multiple instances: A class can have multiple constructors, whereas a class can have only one destructor.

Default behavior: If a class does not have a user-defined constructor, the compiler generates a default constructor, whereas if a class does not have a user-defined destructor, the compiler generates a default destructor.

Memory allocation: Constructors can be used to allocate memory for an object, whereas destructors can be used to free memory that was allocated for the object.

Inheritance: Constructors and destructors are inherited by derived classes, but derived classes can also have their own constructors and destructors that override the base class constructors and destructors.

Visibility: Constructors can be defined as public, protected, or private, depending on how the class should be accessed, whereas destructors are typically defined as public so that objects can be cleaned up properly when they go out of scope.

Overall, constructors and destructors have different roles in object initialization and cleanup, and they have different syntax and behavior in the C++ language.
