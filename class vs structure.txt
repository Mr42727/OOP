In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that can encapsulate both data and behavior, while
 a structure is a user-defined data type that can only encapsulate data.
By default, class members are private, whereas structure members are public.
Classes can have inheritance, while structures cannot.
Classes can have member functions, while structures cannot.
Classes can have constructors and destructors, while structures cannot.
Classes can have access specifiers (public, private, protected) to control access to their members, while structures cannot.
Classes can have virtual functions for dynamic polymorphism, while structures cannot.
Classes can have friend functions to access their private members, while structures cannot.
Objects of classes are passed by reference, while objects of structures are passed by value.
Classes can be used to create abstract data types, while structures cannot.














I'm assuming you are asking for an example of defining a class and a structure in C++.

Here's an example of a class:

arduino
Copy code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    int x, y;

    void print() {
        cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.x = 1;
    obj.y = 2;
    obj.print();
    return 0;
}
In this example, we define a class called MyClass that has two public data members x and y,
 and a public member function print() that prints the values of x and y. We then create an 
object of MyClass called obj, set its x and y values to 1 and 2, respectively, and call its print() function to print its values.

Here's an example of a structure:

c
Copy code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct MyStruct {
    int x, y;
};

void print(MyStruct s) {
    cout << "x = " << s.x << ", y = " << s.y << endl;
}

int main() {
    MyStruct s;
    s.x = 1;
    s.y = 2;
    print(s);
    return 0;
}
In this example, we define a structure called MyStruct that has two public data members x and y. We also define a function called print() that takes a MyStruct argument and prints its x and y values. We then create a MyStruct variable called s, set its x and y values to 1 and 2, respectively, and call the print() function to print its values.
